"We play Minecraft Java but pocket edition."

琴声行世觅仙踪，
尘梦悠悠醉夜风。
举盏共酣情未了，
人醒我梦两朦胧。

Introduce:
HML is an all-in-one Minecraft Launcher, you can play Minecraft directly without having to install JDK (Java Development Kit) 
or JRE (Java Runtime Environment). HML is a great choice if you want to experience Minecraft on any device without worrying about user permissions.

PLEASE DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING, UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE YOU DOING!
Remember: "If it ain't broke don't fix it".

How to use:
To run HML, double click on "HML Launcher (Double Click).vbs" and wait for the process.
It will launch the HMCL (Hello Minecraft! Launcher) by Glavo, version 3.5.9.263.
If HMCL notify an update, CLICK CANCEL! Don't click anything else.
And then you just use HMCL normally. If you don't know how to use HMCL, ask Lykke Månestrand.
If you want, you can double click the file "Hello, Minimal Launcher.bat", it will also run HML but you will see a command prompt. Which is only for Lykke Månestrand.

If this is your first time running HML, please connect to the Internet.
HML does not need to download anything, but HMCL will download some resources.

Normally, when you run HML Launcher (Double Click).vbs, there won't be any warnings. Because the code is safe 100%.
But when you run the "Hello, Minimal Launcher.bat" file, Windows Defender will show a warning. But don't worry, just run it. 
Because my .bat and .vbs files is completely safe for your computer. You can directly open them with notepad and analyze the scripts.
Running HML by the .vbs file will not launch any Command Prompt, very user-friendly. 
When launched next time, the old log file will be automatically deleted.
If problems occur, send the log files to Lykke Månestrand.

Troubleshooting:
- If HML.bat closes immediately: Check if your antivirus blocked it.
- If HMCL cannot start Minecraft: Check if your antivirus removed java.exe.

Notes:
- HML is safe for Single Player or LAN (Local Area Network). However, I recommend not joining online servers as 
this is an unofficial launcher and may be flagged by some server anti-cheat systems.
- I have added Azul Zulu JDK 17 and Azul Zulu JDK 8. If you need more JDK or JRE, download portable JDK/JRE.
- If you don't download portable Java, you will have to install Java. Then HML is not all-in-one anymore. This hurts me (Lykke) a lot, you know?
- If HML has any problems while using it, contact Lykke Månestrand. They will be happy to help you, if they deny, electrocute them.
- You can play Minecraft Forge/Minecraft Fabric/Minecraft NeoForge/... HML is similar to HMCL but more convenient than HMCL.
- I added a custom Minecraft folder, it is in "my mc" folder. It downloaded Minecraft Forge 1.12.2.
- This version of HML is only for Windows, neither for Linux/MacOS/Android devices/Apple devices.
- If you want HML for the other Operating Systems, urge Lykke Månestrand.
- HML is inspired by: HMCL, Minecraft Batch Launcher.
- HML is considered "grayware" because it runs Java portably without traditional installation.
- HML may trigger antivirus warnings, but it's safe - you can inspect all scripts yourself.
- HML does not distribute Minecraft game files or Mojang assets.
- All rights to Minecraft belong to Mojang and Microsoft.
